    <h1 class="header">Introduction</h1>

    <div class="p">Your password has been compromised! It’s an alert that we’ve all seen. Passwords are supposed to be something should be kept secret, but little do we know that there are constant threats that are trying to get a hold of our information. Ensuring that we take the correct precautions to minimize the risk of personal information being leaked. Luckily, there are standards laid out to provide businesses the means of storing, encrypting, and preventing our passwords from being stolen. We also have our own personal responsibility to help protect our information by making sure that we follow those guidelines outside of the workplace. </div>
    <h2 class="header">Standards and Frameworks</h2>
    <div> <img src="img/Graph.jpeg" width="350px"="Sheet showing how quickly a hacker can obtain your password"></div>
    <p class="p">When it comes to the standards set in place for password creation, the first place you should always start is with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework. Their priority is to provide a business with an outline of how to correctly set up your security architecture. We will focus on their standards for password protection. Some of these are quite common for us on a daily basis when we sign up for a new app or login to our email. For example, they set a standard that after multiple failed logins an account should be locked, or stored information, like passwords, that needs to be secured should go through a process of salting or hashing to ensure password is encrypted. They also will recommend certain security software that helps with multi-factor authentication and password managers that can help make sure that information stays secure. Our passwords are the first line of defense in authenticating that we are who we say we are. </p>
    <h3 class="header">Potential Threats of Weak Passwords</h3>
    <div><img src="img/1532965698.jpg" height="350px"="Bar chart of common ways to obtain information"></div>
    <p class="p">Threat Actor is another word for a hacker. We grow up thinking that a hacker is what we see in the movies, a guy behind a desk trying to infiltrate a security system. Honestly, the movies do provide a pretty good outline of what threat actors are like, but there are so many ways for them to try to acquire access to something they shouldn’t have. Let’s think about why a threat actor would want your personal information. They could want access to your credit card number, email account, phone number, or find your address. A weak password makes this even easier for them to get. There is a certain type of attack called a Brute Force attack. This is where a hacker tries every possible combination of characters to eventually find the password that allows them access to the account. The Brute Force attack is very common now and especially in websites and apps that don’t have another form of authentication or a standard for how strong passwords should be. Something to note is that the brute force attack uses a list of stolen passwords and usernames and tries them on another website. An example would be the 2015 Dunkin Donuts brute force attack. This attack effected 20,000 members and caused the company to pay a fine/settlement of $650,000 to those affected victims. They did not put enough effort into ensuring that they held their customers and staff to a high standard of making sure passwords were going to be strong enough to protect their information and they suffered. Making sure that you think of the different way that hackers can steal your information is important in ensuring that you use password best practices in every case. </p>
    <h4 class="header">Prevention</h4>
    <p class="p">To ensure that customer credentials are kept safe, organizations can purchase software that is suited to storing passwords safely. One of these would be a password manager. You have probably used one of these if you’ve ever saved your passwords on your browser or phone. Password Managers are essentially a collection of all your saved passwords. You may ask yourself how secure is this if all my passwords are centralized in one location? The answer would be that these password managers not only act as extra protection by encrypting all your passwords individually, but they also monitor if any of your passwords have been leaked. One example would be LastPass, they are a company that sells a password manager software to individuals, families, businesses, and enterprises. They monitor the dark web to ensure that your passwords are not being sold online. LastPass also has a function to help replace any weak or repetitive passwords with stronger ones from a password generator. Password generators are extremely helpful by generating a very strong password and then immediately save that password in the password manager. NIST has also suggested that users use a password manager to consistently monitor any threat possibility to breach your passwords.</p>
    <h5 class="header">Conclusion</h5>
    <p class="p">Finally, the only way to ensure that we protect our information is to understand that we have responsibility to do so. Not only just for our own information, but for others too. Especially in the work environment, you are just as responsible to protect user information by ensuring that your credentials are not stolen. From the security architecture put in place, and making sure that employees are educated on new standards in the industry for password strength, we can all help close those holes in the system to ensure the safety of our personal information. </p>
